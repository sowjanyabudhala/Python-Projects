## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **Python mini-projects** designed to improve problem-solving and programming skills. Each project serves a **unique purpose** and applies **different Python concepts** like functions, loops, conditionals, and libraries.  

📊 **Projects Included**:  
✔ **Time Math Challenge** – Solve math problems against the clock!  
✔ **Basic Calculator** – A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
✔ **Password Generator** – Generates strong passwords based on user-defined rules.  
✔ **ATM Generator** – Simulates basic ATM operations like withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry.  
✔ **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** – Play against the computer in this classic game.  
✔ **Phone Number Details Finder** – Fetches location & carrier details for a given phone number.

## ⚙️ Technical Aspect  
Each project involves different **Python libraries and concepts**:  

1️⃣ **Time Math Challenge**  
- Uses **random** module to generate math problems.  
- Implements a **countdown timer** for challenges.  

2️⃣ **Basic Calculator**  
- Uses **if-else conditions** and **functions** for calculations.  
- Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.  

3️⃣ **Password Generator**  
- Uses **string, random, and secrets** modules to create **strong passwords**.  
- Allows users to select **password length, special characters, and numbers**.  

4️⃣ **ATM Generator**  
- Simulates ATM operations like **withdrawal, deposit, and balance check**.  
- Uses **loops and functions** to handle transactions.  

5️⃣ **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**  
- Implements **if-else statements** for game logic.  
- Uses **random** module for **computer moves**.  

6️⃣ **Phone Number Details Finder**  
- Uses **phonenumbers** module to retrieve **carrier and location** information.  
- Validates phone numbers before processing.
